Jpeginfo v1.5  Copyright (c)  Timo Kokkonen, 1995-1998.

        later (jpegsrc.v6a.tar.gz)

TESTED PLATFORMS
	Linux
	Solaris
        IRIX
	HP-UX

INSTALLATION
	Installation should be very straightforward, just unpack the
	tar file, run configure script, and then compile the program. 
	You may wanna do something like this:

		gunzip -c jpeginfo-1.5.tar.gz | tar xf -
		cd jpeginfo
		./configure
		make
		make strip
		make install

	NOTE! if 'configure' cannot find libjpeg.a or jpeglib.h, then
	you must use the --with-jpeglib option when running configure,
	see 'configure --help'.


HISTORY
	v1.5   - configuration is now done with GNU autoconf, 
		 program now uses free MD5 algorithm,
		 added file size as new field on reports,
		 program now returns exit code 1 if one or more of the jpegs
		 had any errors, useful for testing if particular jpeg is
	         ok from shell scripts, 
	         also if you specify -q (--quiet) option twice on
		 command line, then program won't produce any output.
	v1.4   - added support for calculating MD5 checksums.
	v1.3   - alternative listing format (-l switch) added.
	         new column on reports displaying whether jpeg is 
		 progressive or normal (P/N).
		 new switch -i for printing out even more information
	         about pictures: coding, density, CCIR601 sampling.
	         new switch -f for passing filenames to program from
	         file or stdin.
	v1.2   - improved support for other platforms, minor fixes
        v1.1.2 - small fixes, improvements to Makefile
	v1.1   - modified to use Independent JPEG Group's new v.6a library,
		 minor fixes.
